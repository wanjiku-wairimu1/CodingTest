# CODING TEST
Fibonacci Sequence
This project demonstrates the calculation of the Fibonacci sequence in C using dynamic programming with memoization. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It is defined by the recurrence relation F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), with initial conditions F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.

Development Environment
The source code for this project was developed and tested using the following environment:

Operating System: Windows 10
IDE: Visual Studio Code
C/C++ Support for Visual Studio Code
To enable C/C++ development in Visual Studio Code, you need to install the "C/C++" extension provided by Microsoft. Follow these steps to set up the development environment:

Open Visual Studio Code.

Select the Extensions view icon on the Activity bar on the side or use the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+X).

Search for "C++" in the Extensions view.

Look for the "C/C++" extension provided by Microsoft and click on "Install" to install it.

Once the extension is installed, open or create a .cpp file in Visual Studio Code. The extension will provide syntax highlighting (colorization), smart completions and hovers (IntelliSense), and error checking for C++ code.

Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the Fibonacci sequence code, follow these steps:

Open the folder containing the source code files in Visual Studio Code.

Ensure that you have the C/C++ extension installed as described above.

Open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code by clicking on View -> Terminal.

Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where the source code file is located.

Compile the code using the appropriate compiler command. For example, using G++:

bash
Copy code
g++ -o fibonacci fibonacci.cpp
If the compilation is successful, an executable file named fibonacci.exe (or any name specified in the compilation command) will be generated in the same directory.

Run the program by executing the compiled binary:

bash
Copy code
./fibonacci.exe
The program will execute and display the Fibonacci sequence based on the given arithmetic operations and conditions.
